# Title: Funding Pulse: Pattern Mining in VC Deal Summaries
# Description: Identify hidden patterns in startup funding (Crunch Base) news to uncover key themes and signals in private market deal summaries.

# This project analyzes short investment summaries collected from mock startup funding news. I built a co-occurrence pipeline that detects how specific terms (like "AI", "blockchain", or "credit risk") are commonly connected, allowing financial analysts to uncover hidden patterns in industry trends. The goal is to simulate a lightweight NLP system that could support hedge fund or VC research by surfacing recurring themes, buzzwords, or opportunity clusters.
